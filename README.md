Dataset collected from UCI MAchine Learning Repository based on tests conducted on airfoils of various shapes, angle of attack and wind speed in an anechoic wind tunnel. Used Decision Tree Regressor to fit the data and prediction. Used seaborn for data visualisation, used a pairplot to analyse the features and a heatmap with YlOrRd colour scheme to identify mutual correlations between alpha and delta. Applying Manual Feature Selection between alpha and delta the performance of the model was not found to increase. The performance was found to be better in case of all features taken together for training the model. Found a rmse value of 2.28 and nrmse of 0.072.
